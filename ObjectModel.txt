Pieces of an object

Classes
Associations (Relations)
	+Generric associations
	+CAnonical associations

-Operations:
	+Detection of operations
	+Generic operations: Get/Set, general knowledge, design patterns
	+Domain operations: dynamic model, fuctional model

-Attributes:
	+Find a attributes


II)Class Indentification:
	-Finding objects is important
	-Look for nouns
	-Methods look for verbs
	-Learn about problem domain: Observe your client

	-Finding objs in use cases: methods and objects in use cases.

III)Object types:
	1.Entity Objects:
		+Real world phycical objects: checks, items, customers, saleperson
		+Very persistent
	2.Boundary Objects:
		+In our case: human being (but not all the time)
		+Graphical user interface
	
	3.Control Objects:
		+Represent control taskes performed by system	
	
	-Interface changes more likely than control
	-Control change more likely than application domain
	-Model, view, controller model. 
	-Different controllers does not mean multiple different mains.

IV)How do you find classes?
	-Nouns are good for classes
	-Verbs are good for operations or methods

	Distinguish different types of objects
	Apply design pattern

V)Method list:
	-Description: descripe the method
	-Precondition:
	-Always have postconditions. (What the methods do after being called)
	-Signature: method signature

VI)Relationships between class: 
	_________	Association	two way relationship

	________|>	Inheritance	is-a

	---------S>	Realization

	--------->	Dependency	one way relationship

	<>_______	Aggregation	

	<S>______	Composition	has-a
